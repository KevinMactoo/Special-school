        <p>we run Code Clubs and Bootcamps. We work with our educators and partners to run free coding clubs where 9 to 13-year-olds build and share their ideas. We believe in learning through creation, and our coding projects offer young people plenty of opportunities to be creative and to share their creations with each other.We are part of the Raspberry Pi Foundation. Bootcamps we organize educational events that allow children to create projects based on their talent and interest and have fun by learning, coding and building technology.</p>
